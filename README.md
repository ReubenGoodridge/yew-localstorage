# yew-localstorage
A simple Yew app that counts page refreshes and stores this value in local storage.

## How to run it
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into it with a terminal
3. Ensure that trunk is installed with the command ```cargo install --locked trunk``` this may take a while
4. Use the command ```trunk serve``` to build and run the app. There may be a few errors but they shouldn't stop the code from running.
5. Go to 127.0.0.1:8080 to view the page. The number in the corner should increase as you refresh the page.
